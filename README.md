# Novel-Class-Detection
Implementation of Deep Open Classification model for Novel Class Detection

A limitation of traditional supervised machine learning is the closed work assumption i.e.  that all classes are present when a model is being trained. However, this assumption does not correspond to the real world where new classes of threats are always emerging, and it is impossible to know all classes of threats in advance. The goal is to investigate machine learning algorithms that incorporate novel class detection to automatically identify new classes of threats, and the best way to present these to human experts for further attention.
